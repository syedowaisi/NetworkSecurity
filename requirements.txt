# -e .


# What is -e . in requirements.txt?
# -e means “editable mode”.

# The . means “the current directory” (where your project lives).

# When you list -e . in your requirements.txt, it tells pip to install your current project in a special way called “editable mode.”

# What is “editable mode”?
# Editable mode installs your project so that any changes you make to the code are instantly available—you don’t have to reinstall the package every time you update your code.

# This is mostly used by developers when they are still building or working on a project.

# Why must I have a setup.py?
# setup.py defines your project as a Python package.

# When you run pip install -e ., pip looks at your setup.py to figure out how to "install" your code.

# Without a setup.py or pyproject.toml, pip cannot recognize your project as a package.

# What happens when you pip install -e .?
# Pip creates a "link" in your Python environment that points directly to your project's source code folder.

# Now, editing any .py file in your project directory will update your installed package immediately.
